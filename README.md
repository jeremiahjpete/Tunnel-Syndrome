# Tunnel-Syndrome
Endless Runner Video Game Project

Tunnel Syndrome is a game currently in development that was inspired from various games I've played in the past.
It is an endless runner that sees the player move through various obstacles that must be avoided, in the same vein as games such as Subway Surfers and Temple Run, with the biggest difference being perspective.

This game focuses more on lateral movement as opposed to swiping to avoid obstacles, as players want to avoid the randomly generating obstacles that appear after every few seconds.
